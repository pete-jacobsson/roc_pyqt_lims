# roc_pyqt_lims
A simple LIMS system based off PyQt6 consistent with ROC and frictionless. 

The system is intended for low throughput academic use and easy configurability at code level.
The ideal goal is high level of module autonomy allowing for easy exchange of modules between this and other projects.
